# peptide_water_HMR_AMBER_to_Anton_Test

Build and setup information

-Small system consisting of a 3 residue peptide ( ARF ) generated using MOE, and solvated in a

-waterbox of 5Ã… padding with .15 KCl generated using charmm-gui.

-System topology converted to equivalent AMBER format using parmed 

-parmed psf to parm7 conversion script adapted from build phase of a previous system built in charmm-gui

-equilibration and minimization scripts adapted from equivalent phases of a previous system built in charmm-gui

-Hydrogen Mass Repartitioning perfomed on standard system parm7 using parmed 'HMassRepartion' command
